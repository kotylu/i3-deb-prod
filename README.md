# i3 for debian11

This is my space where I store all of my configs

# Debian Transparent Terminal
For what I know debian default `gnome-terminal` does not support opacity
```bash
sudo apt-get remove gnome-terminal
sudo apt-get install ./gnome-terminal-data_3.28.1-1ubuntu1mint2_all.deb
sudo apt-get install ./gnome-terminal_3.28.1-1ubuntu1mint2_amd64.deb
```
